Normalization method for DaophotLc time series:

The normalization (calculation of magnitude offsets to each
observation) occurs in two steps. The first is an iterative scheme in
which the code picks an observation as a baseline and iterates
the following two steps:

1) Expand the set of normalized observations by normalizing all
observations that contain reference stars for which magnitudes have
been determined.  New normalizations are determined by either median
or average

2) Expand the set of known reference stars to include all reference
stars in the set of currently normalized images.  The new magnitudes
are determined by either median or average of all occurances of a
given refernce star.

until no new observations can be added.  The set of normalized reference
star measurements are then sigma clipped based on the estimated normalization
solution and reference star magnitudes.  The second step is an analytic
solution to the chi^2 minimization 

chi2 = sum over n & t ( ( mag(t,n) - Mag(n) - dMag(t) ) / err(t,n) )^2

where mag(t,n) and err(t,n) are the uncalibrated measured quantities and
Mag(n) and dMag(t) are the parameters to be fit.  Since the resulting
system of equations is underconstrained, an additional constraint is 
imposed in that one of the dMag(t) is set to zero, defining the
reference observation.

Explanation of fields in DaophotLc:

mag: normalized target star magnitude
err: Daophot reported magnitude error
sky: Daophot sky value (adu)
xpix & ypix: pixel coordinates in ctio observation
xFWHM & yFWHM: Daophot reported psf parameters
	*** Doug *** these are Half-Width-Half-Max!!!!
chi2: 
 & sharp:

dMag: Fit magnitude offset to the reference observation
dErr: Statistical error in dMag:
	dErr(t) = sqrt( sum over n ( 1 / err(t,n)^2 ) )
dChi2: Chi^2 / d.o.f. of reference stars in observation to normalization fit:
	dChi2(t) = sum over n ((mag(t,n)-Mag(n)-dMag(t))/err(t,n) )^2/N
	where N is the number of reference stars in observation t.


Note: The normalization stars magnitudes ( Mag(n) ) and their fit statistics
are currently not output.
